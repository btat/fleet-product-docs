= Status Fields

This shows how status fields are propagated from one resource to another:

== Cluster and Bundle States

Clusters and Bundles have different states in each phase of applying Bundles.

=== Bundles

*Ready*: Bundles have been deployed and all resources are ready.

*NotReady*: Bundles have been deployed and some resources are not ready.

*WaitApplied*: Bundles have been synced from Fleet controller and downstream cluster, but are waiting to be deployed.

*ErrApplied*: Bundles have been synced from the Fleet controller and the downstream cluster, but there were some errors when deploying the Bundle.

*OutOfSync*: Bundles have been synced from Fleet controller, but downstream agent hasn't synced the change yet.

*Pending*: Bundles are being processed by Fleet controller.

*Modified*: Bundles have been deployed and all resources are ready, but there are some changes that were not made from the Git Repository.

=== Clusters

*WaitCheckIn*: Waiting for agent to report registration information and cluster status back.

*NotReady*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in NotReady state.

*WaitApplied*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in WaitApplied state.

*ErrApplied*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in ErrApplied state.

*OutOfSync*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in OutOfSync state.

*Pending*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in Pending state.

*Modified*: There are bundles in this cluster that are in Modified state.

*Ready*: Bundles in this cluster have been deployed and all resources are ready.

== Resources List

The resources lists contain the deployed resources, categorized under `Bundles` and `GitRepos`.

=== Bundles

The deployed resources within bundles can be found in `status.ResourceKey`. This key represents the actual resources deployed via `bundleDeployments`.

=== GitRepos

Similar to bundles, the deployed resources in `GitRepos` are listed in `status.Resources`. This list is also derived from `bundleDeployments`.

== Resource Counts

=== GitRepos

The `status.ResourceCounts` list for GitRepos is derived from `bundleDeployments`.

=== Clusters

In Clusters, the `status.ResourceCounts` list is derived from GitRepos.

=== ClusterGroups

In ClusterGroups, the `status.ResourceCounts` list is also derived from GitRepos.
